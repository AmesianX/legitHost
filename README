Simply put, legitHost is a legit host. It is a tool exploits a weakness in various
multicast and broadcast The tool has a modular architecture and supports
currently: ARP, LLMNR and NetBios Name Service protocols.

As an example, the ARP module listens for ARP Requests and depending on the user
defined configuration in modules/arp.cfg replies with an ARP response
containing an IP Address set by the user.

Each module has an own configuration file, a condition method that returns True
or False depending on wether it should handle the received packet and an action
method that is run on the packet (e.g Send a reply) if condition returns True.

TODO:
    New protocols: (MDNS, SSDP etc,.)
    Suggestions are welcome

Dependencies:
    pylibpcap: Traffic listener.
