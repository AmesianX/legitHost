LegitHost is a tool for exploiting weaknesses in various multicast and
broadcast The tool has a modular architecture and supports currently: ARP,
LLMNR and NetBios Name Service protocols.  Simply put, legitHost is a legit
host. 

As an example, the ARP module listens for ARP Requests and depending on
the user
defined configuration in modules/arp.cfg replies with an ARP response
containing an IP Address set by the user.

Each module has an own configuration file, a condition method that returns True
or False depending on wether it should handle the received packet and an action
method that is run on the packet (e.g Send a reply) if condition returns True.

Example usage:
    Help:
	$python legithost.py -h
    Run on interface eth0:
	$sudo python legithost.py -i eth0 -d 1
    Debug level 2 + Listen mode (won't send responses):
	$sudo python legithost.py -i eth0 -d 2 -l
    Use only LMNR and NBNS modules:
	$sudo python legithost.py -i wlan0 -m llmnr nbns

TODO:
    New protocols: (MDNS, SSDP etc,.)
    Suggestions are welcome

Dependencies:
    pylibpcap: Traffic listener.
