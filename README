Simply put, legitHost is a legit host. It is a tool exploits a weakness in various
multicast and broadcast The tool has a modular architecture and supports
currently: ARP, LLMNR

For example, the ARP module listens for ARP Requests and depending on the user
defined configuration in modules/arp.cfg replies with an ARP response
containing an IP Address set by the user.

Each module has an own configuration file, a condition method in which it
decides to react to the received packet or not and an action method that is
triggered if the condition returns True.
